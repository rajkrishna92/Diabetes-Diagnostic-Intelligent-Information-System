## Abstract
In the present paper, we deal with the design and development of Soft Computing base Information system using the concept of generating Linguistic Strings through non-linear Fuzzy Membership Functions for detecting the classification criterion of Diabetes. The proposed system, on one hand, will help the patient in adopting a proper strategy to evaluate his present sugar level and follow a balanced lifestyle on the other hand it will provide a quantitative base to medical experts in detecting the disease and suggesting proper action to the patients. The proposed information system is tested on real-life data with a satisfactory result as per the medical experts.
